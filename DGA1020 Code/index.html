 <p>
     DaVinci Resolve is a free video editing program made by Blackmagic Design.
    It’s used by both students and movie pros because it has everything you may need — editing, colour fixing, sound, and special effects.
    The free version gives you a lot of powerful tools, like colour correction, video cutting, and cool effects.
    If you want even more features, there’s a paid version called DaVinci Resolve Studio.
    You can work with high-quality videos, and it works with many types of cameras.
    It might seem hard at first, but after some practise, it becomes a very easy tool to use.
